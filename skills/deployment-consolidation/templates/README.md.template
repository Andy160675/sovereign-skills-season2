# {{PROJECT_NAME}}

**{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}**

## Overview

This repository represents the consolidated deployment of {{PROJECT_NAME}}, organized according to best practices for sovereign infrastructure architecture. The consolidation follows the principle of **"measure twice, cut once"** with full cryptographic traceability and zero-dependency deployment readiness.

## Key Principles

### Sovereign Systems Architecture

The repository follows **Sovereign Systems Architecture** principles:

- **Zero-dependency mindset**: All systems designed for autonomous operation
- **Cryptographic integrity**: Evidence-bound snapshots and attestations
- **Build-first execution**: Deployment-ready configurations
- **Operational sovereignty**: Full offline and online independence

### Deployment Philosophy

**Measure twice, cut once** - Every deployment includes:

1. Structure verification
2. Script syntax validation
3. Cryptographic attestation generation
4. Deterministic manifest creation
5. Git commit with full audit trail

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Git 2.30+
- Python 3.11+
- Bash 4.0+
- Docker (for containerized deployments)

### Deployment

#### Dry Run (Preview)

```bash
cd scripts/deployment
./master_deploy.sh --dry-run
```

#### Confirmed Deployment

```bash
./master_deploy.sh --confirm
```

#### Deploy and Push to Remote

```bash
./master_deploy.sh --confirm --push
```

### Verification

The deployment script automatically:

- Verifies repository structure
- Validates Python script syntax
- Checks Git status
- Generates deployment manifest
- Creates cryptographic attestation

## Deployment Artifacts

Each deployment generates:

1. **Deployment Manifest** (`evidence/snapshots/deployment_manifest_TIMESTAMP.json`)
   - Deployment metadata
   - File statistics
   - Structure verification results

2. **Cryptographic Attestation** (`evidence/attestations/deployment_attestation_TIMESTAMP.sha256`)
   - SHA256 hash of entire repository
   - Timestamp and responsible person
   - Audit trail reference

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow available at `build/ci-cd/github-actions-workflow.yml`

Pipeline stages:

1. **Verify Structure** - Validate directory structure
2. **Verify Python** - Syntax check and linting
3. **Verify Shell** - ShellCheck validation
4. **Generate Attestation** - Cryptographic attestation
5. **Build Report** - Comprehensive build report
6. **Deploy Notification** - Deployment readiness notification

## Responsible Person

**{{RESPONSIBLE_PERSON}}**

All deployments are cryptographically attested and assigned to the responsible person for accountability and operational sovereignty.

## Evidence and Compliance

All deployments maintain:

- **Evidence snapshots** - Deployment manifests
- **Cryptographic attestations** - SHA256 hashes
- **Audit logs** - Complete deployment history

## Support

For questions or issues:

- Review documentation in `docs/`
- Check deployment logs in `evidence/`
- Verify attestations in `evidence/attestations/`
